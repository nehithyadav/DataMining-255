# Project  MileStone -Integrated Disease Surveillance and Early Warning System

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to successfully implement and operationalize an Integrated Disease Surveillance and Early Warning System (IDSEWS). Through the establishment of IDSEWS, the project aims to enhance public health preparedness by enabling timely detection and response to disease outbreaks. The key focus is on strengthening the overall capacity for disease surveillance, facilitating early warning mechanisms, and fostering a more effective and coordinated public health response. The successful implementation of IDSEWS will contribute to a proactive and efficient approach in addressing emerging health threats, ultimately minimizing the impact of disease outbreaks on public health.

Dataset:

The foundation of our Integrated Disease Surveillance and Early Warning System (IDSEWS) rests upon two comprehensive datasets sourced from reputable institutions: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-Gov).
